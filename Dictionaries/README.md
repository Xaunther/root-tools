## Summary

Place where dictionaries with variable values are stored. Basically, constant initializers and roofit variable names, which may be different for different analyses/fits. For each analysis, a default behaviour is defined in its `Dictionaries/Project_variables.txt` file, but the functions that use these allow for this behaviour to be customized, by setting new labels or using non-default ones.
